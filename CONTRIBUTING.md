SimpleDMS is [selling exceptions to the AGPL](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions). Therefore it is necessary for contributors to sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA).

You can find more information on the business model of SimpleDMS in the README:
https://github.com/simpledms/simpledms?tab=readme-ov-file#open-source-philosophy-and-business-model

An article from Richard Stallman on the practice of selling exceptions to the GPL can be found on the Free Software Foundation blog:
https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions

The CLA is based on the Individual Contributor License Agreement v2.2 by the Apache Software Foundation. You can find the CLA in the repository:
https://github.com/simpledms/simpledms/blob/main/.cla/v1/cla.md

Please let me know if you have any questions about the CLA or have any concerns about it. I'm open for discussions as I want to find the best solution for SimpleDMS and potential contributors.
